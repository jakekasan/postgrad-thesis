# Unit Root Tests in Panel Data

## Synopsis

This thesis investigated the claim that Panel Data Unit Root tests had increased power compared to single time series tests. The investigation involved creating panel data from controlled processes and performing both single and panel tests and then comparing the results.

## Repository

In the **thesis** folder is where all the LaTeX code and resources used to compile the final PDF are kept.
The **code** folder contains all the R code done to create the panels and perform the Monte Carlo simulations.

## To-Do

- clean up the code
